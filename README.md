# 📊 Customer Segmentation Project 🚀

## 🔍 Overview
Understanding customer behavior is a game-changer for businesses looking to boost engagement, personalize marketing, and maximize revenue. This project applies advanced clustering techniques to uncover distinct customer groups based on their purchasing patterns, enabling data-driven decision-making.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset consists of **5,000,000+ customer records**, including key behavioral attributes:
- **Customer ID** (Unique identifier)
- **Recency** (Days since last purchase)
- **Frequency** (Number of transactions)
- **Monetary Value** (Total amount spent)

### 🛠 Data Preprocessing
To ensure high-quality clustering results, the following preprocessing steps were applied:
- **Missing Values:** Imputed using **KNN imputation** for accurate data completion.
- **Outliers:** Detected and removed to prevent skewed clustering.
- **Feature Scaling:** Standardized using **StandardScaler** to ensure balanced clustering outcomes.

## 🔬 Methodology
### 🏷 Clustering Techniques
1. **K-Means Clustering**
   - **Optimal Clusters:** Determined using the **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Score**.
   - **Final Model:** Customers segmented into **3 distinct clusters**.
   
2. **Hierarchical Clustering**
   - Provided insights into hierarchical relationships among customer segments.
   
3. **HDBSCAN (Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**
   - Identified meaningful customer groups while filtering out noise for better segmentation.

## 📊 Results & Business Insights
### **Final Clusters:**
- **🟢 Cluster 0 (VIP Customers):** High-value, frequent buyers with strong brand loyalty.
- **🟡 Cluster 1 (Regular Shoppers):** Moderate spenders with steady purchasing behavior.
- **🔴 Cluster 2 (Infrequent Buyers):** Low-value customers who purchase sporadically.

📌 **Key Evaluation Metrics:**
- **Silhouette Score:** **0.58**, indicating well-separated clusters.
- **Elbow Method:** Optimal **k = 3** based on WCSS (Within-Cluster Sum of Squares).

📈 **Actionable Insights:**
- **Cluster 0:** Focus on VIP retention with loyalty programs and exclusive offers.
- **Cluster 1:** Increase purchase frequency through personalized promotions.
- **Cluster 2:** Re-engage with targeted discounts and email marketing campaigns.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis and visualization
- **SQL** for data extraction and manipulation

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
1. Download the dataset and place it in the project directory.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`Customer_Segmmentation.ipynb`).
3. Run all cells to preprocess data, perform clustering, and visualize the results.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- Implement deep learning-based customer segmentation.
- Optimize clustering parameters for even finer customer granularity.
- Integrate real-time segmentation for dynamic customer insights.
